# Image Albums

Login to create albums and upload images into your albums. Remove images from albums or remove albums entirely. Toggle the privacy of your albums for other users to view. View public albums and their images shared by other users. Add another user's image to your favorites. This gives that image's album a point and you'll be able to see that image in your favorite images collection. You can un-favorite an image from your collection. This will subtract a point from the album. 

Can upload multiple images to an album at once. When browsing public albums, you may sort by title, date posted, and points by clicking on the respective headers, and reverse the sort order by clicking on them again. You may also filter by entering keywords into the input then hit go. The filtered results will show the albums with tags that include at least one of your keywords.
